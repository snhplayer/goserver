When you forget your keys at home
When you accidentally spill coffee on important documents
When you lose your wallet on public transport
When you forget to turn off the iron before leaving
When you are late for an important meeting due to traffic
When you can't find the necessary file on your computer
When you forget the password to your account
When you accidentally send a message to the wrong person
When you forget to buy a gift for a friend's birthday
When you can't find a parking spot
When the elevator breaks down and you have to walk up the stairs
When you forget to charge your phone before a long trip
When you accidentally break your favorite cup
When you can't find the needed book in the library
When you forget to turn off the water in the bathroom
When you can't remember the name of a new acquaintance
When you accidentally delete an important file
When you can't find your glasses
When you forget about an important meeting
When you can't find the necessary phone number
